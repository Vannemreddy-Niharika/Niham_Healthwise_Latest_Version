- ✅ Navigation buttons (Home, Explore, Remedies, etc.)
- ✅ Search placeholders
- ✅ Button labels (Search, Show All, Send, etc.)
- ✅ Section headings
- ✅ Field labels (Severity, Diet, Medication, Time, Curable)

All 35+ disease names translate:
- ✅ Fever → बुखार (Hindi)
- ✅ Common Cold → सामान्य सर्दी (Hindi)
- ✅ Diabetes → मधुमेह (Hindi)
- ✅ And all others!

### 3. **Basic Fields (100%)**
These translate for all diseases:
- ✅ Severity levels (Low, Medium, High, etc.)

## ⚠️ What's Partially Working

### Content Translation (30-40%)

**What Translates:**
- ✅ Common phrases like "Fluids, fruits, light meals"
- ✅ Common medications like "Paracetamol, rest"
- ✅ Basic remedy instructions

**What Doesn't Translate Yet:**
- ❌ Disease-specific detailed content
- ❌ Complex medication instructions
- ❌ Detailed remedy descriptions
- ❌ Specific dietary recommendations

**Why?**
These need to be added to the translation dictionary. The system is ready - it just needs more translations added!

## 💡 Why Some Content Stays in English

The translation system works like this:

1. **You change language** → System activates
2. **System looks up each word/phrase** in dictionary
3. **If found** → Translates ✅
4. **If not found** → Shows English ❌

**Solution:** Add more translations to the dictionary!

See `ADD_MORE_TRANSLATIONS_HERE.md` for instructions.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any changes"
**Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or open in incognito mode

### "Only some words translate"
**Expected!** Only words in the dictionary translate. Add more to translate more!

### "Voice buttons don't appear"
**Fix:** Use Chrome or Edge browser (best voice support)

### "Translations are slow"
**Normal!** First time takes 1-2 seconds. After that, it's instant (cached).
